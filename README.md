## I. Background:
In today's data-driven business environment, leveraging data for strategic decision-making is crucial for gaining competitive advantages. Understanding customer behavior, market trends, and operational efficiencies through data analysis can significantly improve a company's performance. However, raw data often contains noise and inconsistencies that need to be addressed before meaningful insights can be extracted. This report aims to perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a provided dataset to uncover patterns and insights that can drive informed business decisions.

## II. Objectives:
The primary objective of this EDA is to clean, validate, and analyze the dataset named P2M3_<nama-student>_data_raw.csv. Through this process, we aim to achieve the following:

**1. Data Cleaning:**
  - Remove duplicate entries.
  - Normalize column names for consistency and readability.
  - Handle missing values to ensure data integrity.

**2. Data Validation:**
  - Utilize Great Expectations to implement data validation checks ensuring data quality.
  - Ensure that the dataset meets predefined expectations for uniqueness, range, data type, and set membership.

**3. Data Analysis:**
  - Perform exploratory analysis to identify key trends and patterns within the dataset.
  - Create visualizations to support the analysis and provide actionable insights.

**4. Automation:**
  - Develop an Apache Airflow DAG to automate the data fetching, cleaning, and posting processes.
  - Ensure the pipeline runs at a scheduled time to maintain updated data for analysis.

**5. Visualization and Reporting:**
  - Use Kibana to create a dashboard with various visualizations to present the analysis results.
  - Provide insights and recommendations based on the visualizations to inform business strategies.

  - Sales Team: To identify high-performing products and potential market opportunities.
  - Operations Team: To improve efficiency by analyzing order processing and delivery times.
  - Management Team: To make strategic decisions based on comprehensive data insights.
    
## IV. Use Case:
The dataset is presumed to contain information on customer orders, including order details, customer information, and sales data. By analyzing this dataset, we can identify trends such as seasonal sales patterns, high-value customers, and product performance, enabling the company to optimize marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer engagement practices.

## V. Expected Outcomes:
  - Actionable Insights: Clear identification of trends and patterns that can drive strategic initiatives.
  - Data Quality Assurance: Ensured through thorough data cleaning and validation processes.
  - Automated Workflow: An efficient data pipeline that ensures timely and accurate data updates.
  - Comprehensive Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard providing at-a-glance insights for different stakeholders.
By achieving these objectives, the EDA report will not only provide immediate value through insights but also establish a robust framework for ongoing data analysis and business intelligence.
